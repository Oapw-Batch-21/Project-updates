The Win-Win OAPW (Online add posting website) is a wonderful advertising concept and it also lies at the heart of Advertising Empire. Though new advertising concepts keep coming up all the time, this one is something that is altogether different. OAPW (Advertising program) presents an earning opportunity to the website owners and members by allowing others to post advertisements on their websites / webpage. These advertisements are either text advertisements or image based advertisements.


MVC architecture with advance java

Model View Controller or MVC as it is popularly called, is a software design pattern for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is made up of the following three parts 

 Model − The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.
 View − This is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
 Controller − Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.

MVC is popular as it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns. Here the Controller receives all requests for the application and then works with the Model to prepare any data needed by the View. The View then uses the data prepared by the Controller to generate a final presentable response.

Today we discussed about the papers which helped us to take this project. The papers which we reffered are Pricing Models in Web Advertising(Springer paper) and the Internet advertising: the specifics, tendencies of development and impact on sales(Journal paper).
